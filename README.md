# Wyvern Items
Items extracted from **Wyvernmods** by *Sindusk*

Properties file has options to add items to traders, set quality of those items, and set the value on them.

**Affinity Orb** - Grants the player a random affinity when consumed.

**Enchant Orb** - Can be enchanted. Can be consumed to transfer the enchant to any item.

**Depth Drill** - Drills a tile corner, revealing the amount of dirt until you hit rock. Beyond that, it can also locate nearby ores.

**Disintegration Rod** - This rod removes the configured amount of hits from any vein (no ore is provided) or instantly destroys a cave wall (like the Disintegrate spell).

**Chaos Crystal**s - A volatile crystal that can be infused with items for a variety of outcomes. It can increase rarity, or destroy the item outright. Uses the "Artifacts" skill.

**Enchanters Crystals** - This crystal can adjust the enchant properties of an item. Uses the "Artifacts" skill.

**Arrow Packs** - Craft 40 arrows and a quiver into an arrow pack. Improve the arrow pack, then unpack to receive a quiver with 40 arrows of the QL of the arrow pack. This also transfers any enchants from the Arrow Pack to all 40 arrows

**Affinity Catcher** - The Affinity Catcher can be used to "capture" and sell your affinities to other players or characters.
You require a minimum of 3 total affinities in order to use an Affinity Catcher.
To use the item, you must have it in your inventory and activated. Right-click on the skill in your skills window with the affinity you want to capture and use "Capture affinity"
When this is done, assuming you meet the conditions to have the affinity captured, it will absorb the affinity from your character and place it in the catcher. The catcher will automatically rename to "captured X affinity" to signify that it contains the affinity.
To redeem the affinity, simply activate and right click the captured affinity and select "Gain affinity" - the captured affinity will be consumed and you will obtain the affinity it had captured.

**Eternal Orb** - The purpose of this item is to allow players to move their runes, imbues, and enchants from one item to another. Forcing players to re-create their highly enchanted, runed, and imbued tools as a new material seems unjustified and un-fun.  
To use an eternal orb, activate the orb, then target the item of choice and use "Absorb enchants" 
This will consume the Eternal Orb, create an Enchant Orb, then move any rune, all imbues, and any enchants onto the Enchant Orb. 
If the target item does not have any enchants, it will give a message saying so and the orb will not be used. 
Eternal Orbs do not transfer rarity.

**Enchant Orb** - If there is a rune on the enchant orb, and a rune on the target item, it will refuse to transfer the rune, and remain on the Enchant Orb. 
Enchant Orbs handle imbue transfers intelligently. 
If there is no imbue on the target item, the imbue will transfer in its entirety like any enchant. 
If there is an imbue, and the combined total of the imbue on the Enchant Orb and target item are less than 100, it will add them together and apply it to the target item. 
If there is an imbue, but combining the two would total over 100, the Enchant Orb will only transfer as much as necessary to achieve 100 power in the imbue. The remainder will stay on the Enchant Orb. 
If there is an imbue already at 100, it will refuse to transfer the imbue and it will remain on the Enchant Orb.
If there are two conflicting enchants on the Enchant Orb, such as AOSP and Web Armour, it will apply the first one, then negate the second one down the list because it now has a negating enchant. 
Enchant Orbs are only consumed when all of the enchants have been transferred off the orb, instead of when any transfer succeeds. 
Enchant Orbs can transfer enchants to items that used to refuse to accept enchants from Enchant Orbs (like Expand casts to frying pans, forges, etc.)

**Book of Conversion** - This book can be consumed to change religious deity. You will automatically become a priest of the deity you select. Alignment will update. If you are black light and switching to white light, your alignment will swap to positive. In the other direction, if you select Libila, your alignment will swap to go negative.
The conversion will come at the cost of 10% of your total faith. There is no cooldown.
